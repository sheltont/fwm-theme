    // Note: this technique has issues on Android 3.x
    // An alternative that requires the :before generated content was added to H5BP
    // See: https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/css/main.css

    //color:transparent; font:0/0 a; text-shadow:none; vertical-align:middle;

    // The simplest option remains using text-indent:-9999px despite the performance drawback
    text-indent: -9999px;

// Undo the replacement for child elements
